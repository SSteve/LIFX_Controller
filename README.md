# Overview

The Autolog LIFX Controller is a plugin for version 7+ of the [Indigo Home Automation system][1]. It enables you to control [LIFX][2] devices directly from Indigo. It provides local LAN control of LIFX Devices without having to use an internet connection.

The Version 5 series of the plugin is implemented using an Indigo Dimmer device to control the LIFX device and fully supports the built-in RGBW controls in Indigo 7. In addition to the standard controls, the plugin provides a comprehensive action (Set Color/White) to control all aspects of the LIFX device and a number of additional actions.

The plugin makes extensive use of the [lifxlan library][3] by Meghan Clark for which much thanks are due :)

It is **strongly recommended** to read the [Wiki Documentation][4] to familiarise yourself with the new way of working which is substantially different to earlier plugin versions (V1, V2 and V3).
