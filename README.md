The Autolog LIFX Controller enables you to control [LIFX][1] devices directly from Indigo. It provides local LAN control of LIFX Devices without having to use an internet connection. It is implemented using an Indigo Dimmer device to control the LIFX device and fully supports the built-in RGBW controls in Indigo 7. In addition to the standard controls, the plugin provides a comprehensive action (Set Color/White) to control all aspects of the LIFX device and a number of additional actions.

The plugin makes extensive use of the [lifxlan library][2] by Meghan Clark for which much thanks are due :)
